## `jj`

Jujutsu (An experimental VCS)

To get started, see the tutorial [`jj help -k tutorial`].

[`jj help -k tutorial`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/tutorial/

**Usage:** `jj [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]`

'jj help --help' lists available keywords. Use 'jj help -k' to show help for one of these keywords.


###### **Subcommands:**

* `abandon` — Abandon a revision
* `absorb` — Move changes from a revision into the stack of mutable revisions
* `bookmark` — Manage bookmarks [default alias: b]
* `commit` — Update the description and create a new change on top
* `config` — Manage config options
* `describe` — Update the change description or other metadata
* `diff` — Compare file contents between two revisions
* `diffedit` — Touch up the content changes in a revision with a diff editor
* `duplicate` — Create new changes with the same content as existing ones
* `edit` — Sets the specified revision as the working-copy revision
* `evolog` — Show how a change has evolved over time
* `file` — File operations
* `fix` — Update files with formatting fixes or other changes
* `git` — Commands for working with Git remotes and the underlying Git repo
* `help` — Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
* `interdiff` — Compare the changes of two commits
* `log` — Show revision history
* `new` — Create a new, empty change and (by default) edit it in the working copy
* `next` — Move the working-copy commit to the child revision
* `operation` — Commands for working with the operation log
* `parallelize` — Parallelize revisions by making them siblings
* `prev` — Change the working copy revision relative to the parent revision
* `rebase` — Move revisions to different parent(s)
* `resolve` — Resolve conflicted files with an external merge tool
* `restore` — Restore paths from another revision
* `revert` — Apply the reverse of the given revision(s)
* `root` — Show the current workspace root directory (shortcut for `jj workspace root`)
* `show` — Show commit description and changes in a revision
* `sign` — Cryptographically sign a revision
* `simplify-parents` — Simplify parent edges for the specified revision(s)
* `sparse` — Manage which paths from the working-copy commit are present in the working copy
* `split` — Split a revision in two
* `squash` — Move changes from a revision into another revision
* `status` — Show high-level repo status
* `tag` — Manage tags
* `undo` — Undo an operation (shortcut for `jj op undo`)
* `unsign` — Drop a cryptographic signature
* `util` — Infrequently used commands such as for generating shell completions
* `version` — Display version information
* `workspace` — Commands for working with workspaces

###### **Options:**

* `-R`, `--repository <REPOSITORY>` — Path to repository to operate on

   By default, Jujutsu searches for the closest .jj/ directory in an ancestor of the current working directory.
* `--ignore-working-copy` — Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it

   By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the working copy.

   Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies `--ignore-working-copy`.
* `--ignore-immutable` — Allow rewriting immutable commits

   By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits. This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.

   This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or the `immutable` template keyword.
* `--at-operation <AT_OPERATION>` [alias: `at-op`] — Operation to load the repo at

   Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.

   You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.

   Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation ID is enough.

   When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.

   It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation. Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.
* `--debug` — Enable debug logging
* `--color <WHEN>` — When to colorize output

  Possible values: `always`, `never`, `debug`, `auto`

* `--quiet` — Silence non-primary command output

   For example, `jj file list` will still list files, but it won't tell you if the working copy was snapshotted or if descendants were rebased.

   Warnings and errors will still be printed.
* `--no-pager` — Disable the pager
* `--config <NAME=VALUE>` — Additional configuration options (can be repeated)

   The name should be specified as TOML dotted keys. The value should be specified as a TOML expression. If string value isn't enclosed by any TOML constructs (such as array notation), quotes can be omitted.
* `--config-file <PATH>` — Additional configuration files (can be repeated)



## `jj abandon`

Abandon a revision

Abandon a revision, rebasing descendants onto its parent(s). The behavior is similar to `jj restore --changes-in`; the difference is that `jj abandon` gives you a new change, while `jj restore` updates the existing change.

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

**Usage:** `jj abandon [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to abandon (default: @)

###### **Options:**

* `--retain-bookmarks` — Do not delete bookmarks pointing to the revisions to abandon

   Bookmarks will be moved to the parent revisions instead.
* `--restore-descendants` — Do not modify the content of the children of the abandoned commits



## `jj absorb`

Move changes from a revision into the stack of mutable revisions

This command splits changes in the source revision and moves each change to the closest mutable ancestor where the corresponding lines were modified last. If the destination revision cannot be determined unambiguously, the change will be left in the source revision.

The source revision will be abandoned if all changes are absorbed into the destination revisions, and if the source revision has no description.

The modification made by `jj absorb` can be reviewed by `jj op show -p`.

**Usage:** `jj absorb [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Move only changes to these paths (instead of all paths)

###### **Options:**

* `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Source revision to absorb from

  Default value: `@`
* `-t`, `--into <REVSETS>` [alias: `to`] — Destination revisions to absorb into

   Only ancestors of the source revision will be considered.

  Default value: `mutable()`



## `jj bookmark`

Manage bookmarks [default alias: b]

See [`jj help -k bookmarks`] for more information.

[`jj help -k bookmarks`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks

**Usage:** `jj bookmark <COMMAND>`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `create` — Create a new bookmark
* `delete` — Delete an existing bookmark and propagate the deletion to remotes on the next push
* `forget` — Forget a bookmark without marking it as a deletion to be pushed
* `list` — List bookmarks and their targets
* `move` — Move existing bookmarks to target revision
* `rename` — Rename `old` bookmark name to `new` bookmark name
* `set` — Create or update a bookmark to point to a certain commit
* `track` — Start tracking given remote bookmarks
* `untrack` — Stop tracking given remote bookmarks



## `jj bookmark create`

Create a new bookmark

**Usage:** `jj bookmark create [OPTIONS] <NAMES>...`

**Command Alias:** `c`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — The bookmarks to create

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` [alias: `to`] — The bookmark's target revision



## `jj bookmark delete`

Delete an existing bookmark and propagate the deletion to remotes on the next push

Revisions referred to by the deleted bookmarks are not abandoned. To delete revisions as well as bookmarks, use `jj abandon`. For example, `jj abandon main..<bookmark>` will abandon revisions belonging to the `<bookmark>` branch (relative to the `main` branch.)

If you don't want the deletion of the local bookmark to propagate to any tracked remote bookmarks, use `jj bookmark forget` instead.

**Usage:** `jj bookmark delete <NAMES>...`

**Command Alias:** `d`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — The bookmarks to delete

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns



## `jj bookmark forget`

Forget a bookmark without marking it as a deletion to be pushed

If a local bookmark is forgotten, any corresponding remote bookmarks will become untracked to ensure that the forgotten bookmark will not impact remotes on future pushes.

**Usage:** `jj bookmark forget [OPTIONS] <NAMES>...`

**Command Alias:** `f`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — The bookmarks to forget

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns

###### **Options:**

* `--include-remotes` — When forgetting a local bookmark, also forget any corresponding remote bookmarks

   A forgotten remote bookmark will not impact remotes on future pushes. It will be recreated on future fetches if it still exists on the remote. If there is a corresponding Git-tracking remote bookmark, it will also be forgotten.



## `jj bookmark list`

List bookmarks and their targets

By default, a tracking remote bookmark will be included only if its target is different from the local target. A non-tracking remote bookmark won't be listed. For a conflicted bookmark (both local and remote), old target revisions are preceded by a "-" and new target revisions are preceded by a "+".

See [`jj help -k bookmarks`] for more information.

[`jj help -k bookmarks`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks

**Usage:** `jj bookmark list [OPTIONS] [NAMES]...`

**Command Alias:** `l`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — Show bookmarks whose local name matches

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns

###### **Options:**

* `-a`, `--all-remotes` — Show all tracking and non-tracking remote bookmarks including the ones whose targets are synchronized with the local bookmarks
* `--remote <REMOTE>` — Show all tracking and non-tracking remote bookmarks belonging to this remote

   Can be combined with `--tracked` or `--conflicted` to filter the bookmarks shown (can be repeated.)

   By default, the specified remote name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select remotes by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns
* `-t`, `--tracked` — Show remote tracked bookmarks only. Omits local Git-tracking bookmarks by default
* `-c`, `--conflicted` — Show conflicted bookmarks only
* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Show bookmarks whose local targets are in the given revisions

   Note that `-r deleted_bookmark` will not work since `deleted_bookmark` wouldn't have a local target.
* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each bookmark using the given template

   All 0-argument methods of the [`CommitRef` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [`CommitRef` type]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commitref-type

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
* `--sort <SORT_KEY>` — Sort bookmarks based on the given key (or multiple keys)

   Suffix the key with `-` to sort in descending order of the value (e.g. `--sort name-`). Note that when using multiple keys, the first key is the most significant.

   This defaults to the `ui.bookmark-list-sort-keys` setting.

  Possible values: `name`, `name-`, `author-name`, `author-name-`, `author-email`, `author-email-`, `author-date`, `author-date-`, `committer-name`, `committer-name-`, `committer-email`, `committer-email-`, `committer-date`, `committer-date-`




## `jj bookmark move`

Move existing bookmarks to target revision

If bookmark names are given, the specified bookmarks will be updated to point to the target revision.

If `--from` options are given, bookmarks currently pointing to the specified revisions will be updated. The bookmarks can also be filtered by names.

Example: pull up the nearest bookmarks to the working-copy parent

$ jj bookmark move --from 'heads(::@- & bookmarks())' --to @-

**Usage:** `jj bookmark move [OPTIONS] <NAMES|--from <REVSETS>>`

**Command Alias:** `m`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — Move bookmarks matching the given name patterns

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns

###### **Options:**

* `-f`, `--from <REVSETS>` — Move bookmarks from the given revisions
* `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Move bookmarks to this revision
* `-B`, `--allow-backwards` — Allow moving bookmarks backwards or sideways



## `jj bookmark rename`

Rename `old` bookmark name to `new` bookmark name

The new bookmark name points at the same commit as the old bookmark name.

**Usage:** `jj bookmark rename <OLD> <NEW>`

**Command Alias:** `r`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OLD>` — The old name of the bookmark
* `<NEW>` — The new name of the bookmark



## `jj bookmark set`

Create or update a bookmark to point to a certain commit

**Usage:** `jj bookmark set [OPTIONS] <NAMES>...`

**Command Alias:** `s`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAMES>` — The bookmarks to update

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` [alias: `to`] — The bookmark's target revision
* `-B`, `--allow-backwards` — Allow moving the bookmark backwards or sideways



## `jj bookmark track`

Start tracking given remote bookmarks

A tracking remote bookmark will be imported as a local bookmark of the same name. Changes to it will propagate to the existing local bookmark on future pulls.

**Usage:** `jj bookmark track <BOOKMARK@REMOTE>...`

**Command Alias:** `t`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<BOOKMARK@REMOTE>` — Remote bookmarks to track

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   Examples: bookmark@remote, glob:main@*, glob:jjfan-*@upstream

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns



## `jj bookmark untrack`

Stop tracking given remote bookmarks

A non-tracking remote bookmark is just a pointer to the last-fetched remote bookmark. It won't be imported as a local bookmark on future pulls.

If you want to forget a local bookmark while also untracking the corresponding remote bookmarks, use `jj bookmark forget` instead.

**Usage:** `jj bookmark untrack <BOOKMARK@REMOTE>...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<BOOKMARK@REMOTE>` — Remote bookmarks to untrack

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   Examples: bookmark@remote, glob:main@*, glob:jjfan-*@upstream

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/#string-patterns



## `jj commit`

Update the description and create a new change on top

**Usage:** `jj commit [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Put these paths in the first commit

###### **Options:**

* `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which changes to include in the first commit
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
* `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)
* `--reset-author` — Reset the author to the configured user

   This resets the author name, email, and timestamp.

   You can use it in combination with the JJ_USER and JJ_EMAIL environment variables to set a different author:

   $ JJ_USER='Foo Bar' JJ_EMAIL=foo@bar.com jj commit --reset-author
* `--author <AUTHOR>` — Set author to the provided string

   This changes author name and email while retaining author timestamp for non-discardable commits.



## `jj config`

Manage config options

Operates on jj configuration, which comes from the config file and environment variables.

See [`jj help -k config`] to know more about file locations, supported config options, and other details about `jj config`.

[`jj help -k config`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/

**Usage:** `jj config <COMMAND>`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `edit` — Start an editor on a jj config file
* `get` — Get the value of a given config option.
* `list` — List variables set in config files, along with their values
* `path` — Print the paths to the config files
* `set` — Update a config file to set the given option to a given value
* `unset` — Update a config file to unset the given option



## `jj config edit`

Start an editor on a jj config file.

Creates the file if it doesn't already exist regardless of what the editor does.

**Usage:** `jj config edit <--user|--repo>`

**Command Alias:** `e`

###### **Options:**

* `--user` — Target the user-level config
* `--repo` — Target the repo-level config



## `jj config get`

Get the value of a given config option.

Unlike `jj config list`, the result of `jj config get` is printed without
extra formatting and therefore is usable in scripting. For example:

$ jj config list user.name
user.name="Martin von Zweigbergk"
$ jj config get user.name
Martin von Zweigbergk

**Usage:** `jj config get <NAME>`

**Command Alias:** `g`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>`



## `jj config list`

List variables set in config files, along with their values

**Usage:** `jj config list [OPTIONS] [NAME]`

**Command Alias:** `l`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>` — An optional name of a specific config option to look up

###### **Options:**

* `--include-defaults` — Whether to explicitly include built-in default values in the list
* `--include-overridden` — Allow printing overridden values
* `--user` — Target the user-level config
* `--repo` — Target the repo-level config
* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each variable using the given template

   The following keywords are available in the template expression:

   * `name: String`: Config name.
   * `value: ConfigValue`: Value to be formatted in TOML syntax.
   * `overridden: Boolean`: True if the value is shadowed by other.
   * `source: String`: Source of the value.
   * `path: String`: Path to the config file.

   Can be overridden by the `templates.config_list` setting. To
   see a detailed config list, use the `builtin_config_list_detailed`
   template.

   See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [`jj help -k templates`]:
       https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/



## `jj config path`

Print the paths to the config files

A config file at that path may or may not exist.

See `jj config edit` if you'd like to immediately edit a file.

**Usage:** `jj config path <--user|--repo>`

**Command Alias:** `p`

###### **Options:**

* `--user` — Target the user-level config
* `--repo` — Target the repo-level config



## `jj config set`

Update a config file to set the given option to a given value

**Usage:** `jj config set <--user|--repo> <NAME> <VALUE>`

**Command Alias:** `s`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>`
* `<VALUE>` — New value to set

   The value should be specified as a TOML expression. If string value isn't enclosed by any TOML constructs (such as apostrophes or array notation), quotes can be omitted. Note that the value may also need shell quoting. TOML multi-line strings can be useful if the value contains apostrophes. For example, to set `foo.bar` to the string "{don't}" use `jj config set --user foo.bar "'''{don't}'''"`. This is valid in both Bash and Fish.

   Alternative, e.g. to avoid dealing with shell quoting, use `jj config edit` to edit the TOML file directly.

###### **Options:**

* `--user` — Target the user-level config
* `--repo` — Target the repo-level config



## `jj config unset`

Update a config file to unset the given option

**Usage:** `jj config unset <--user|--repo> <NAME>`

**Command Alias:** `u`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>`

###### **Options:**

* `--user` — Target the user-level config
* `--repo` — Target the repo-level config



## `jj describe`

Update the change description or other metadata

Starts an editor to let you edit the description of changes. The editor will be $EDITOR, or `pico` if that's not defined (`Notepad` on Windows).

**Usage:** `jj describe [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...`

**Command Alias:** `desc`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSETS>` — The revision(s) whose description to edit (default: @)

###### **Options:**

* `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)

   If multiple revisions are specified, the same description will be used for all of them.
* `--stdin` — Read the change description from stdin

   If multiple revisions are specified, the same description will be used for all of them.
* `--no-edit` — Don't open an editor

   This is mainly useful in combination with e.g. `--reset-author`.
* `--edit` — Open an editor

   Forces an editor to open when using `--stdin` or `--message` to allow the message to be edited afterwards.
* `--reset-author` — Reset the author to the configured user

   This resets the author name, email, and timestamp.

   You can use it in combination with the JJ_USER and JJ_EMAIL environment variables to set a different author:

   $ JJ_USER='Foo Bar' JJ_EMAIL=foo@bar.com jj describe --reset-author
* `--author <AUTHOR>` — Set author to the provided string

   This changes author name and email while retaining author timestamp for non-discardable commits.



## `jj diff`

Compare file contents between two revisions

With the `-r` option, shows the changes compared to the parent revision. If there are several parent revisions (i.e., the given revision is a merge), then they will be merged and the changes from the result to the given revision will be shown.

With the `--from` and/or `--to` options, shows the difference from/to the given revisions. If either is left out, it defaults to the working-copy commit. For example, `jj diff --from main` shows the changes from "main" (perhaps a bookmark name) to the working-copy commit.

If no option is specified, it defaults to `-r @`.

**Usage:** `jj diff [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Restrict the diff to these paths

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Show changes in these revisions

   If there are multiple revisions, then the total diff for all of them will be shown. For example, if you have a linear chain of revisions A..D, then `jj diff -r B::D` equals `jj diff --from A --to D`. Multiple heads and/or roots are supported, but gaps in the revset are not supported (e.g. `jj diff -r 'A|C'` in a linear chain A..C).

   If a revision is a merge commit, this shows changes *from* the automatic merge of the contents of all of its parents *to* the contents of the revision itself.

   If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
* `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Show changes from this revision

   If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
* `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Show changes to this revision

   If none of `-r`, `-f`, or `-t` is provided, then the default is `-r @`.
* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each file diff entry using the given template

   All 0-argument methods of the [`TreeDiffEntry` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [`TreeDiffEntry` type]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#treediffentry-type

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

   The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
* `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

   A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
* `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
* `-w`, `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `-b`, `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj diffedit`

Touch up the content changes in a revision with a diff editor

With the `-r` option, starts a [diff editor] on the changes in the revision.

With the `--from` and/or `--to` options, starts a [diff editor] comparing the "from" revision to the "to" revision.

[diff editor]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#editing-diffs

Edit the right side of the diff until it looks the way you want. Once you close the editor, the revision specified with `-r` or `--to` will be updated. Unless `--restore-descendants` is used, descendants will be rebased on top as usual, which may result in conflicts.

See `jj restore` if you want to move entire files from one revision to another. For moving changes between revisions, see `jj squash -i`.

**Usage:** `jj diffedit [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — The revision to touch up

   Defaults to @ if neither --to nor --from are specified.
* `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Show changes from this revision

   Defaults to @ if --to is specified.
* `-t`, `--to <REVSET>` — Edit changes in this revision

   Defaults to @ if --from is specified.
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used
* `--restore-descendants` — Preserve the content (not the diff) when rebasing descendants

   When rebasing a descendant on top of the rewritten revision, its diff compared to its parent(s) is normally preserved, i.e. the same way that descendants are always rebased. This flag makes it so the content/state is preserved instead of preserving the diff.



## `jj duplicate`

Create new changes with the same content as existing ones

When none of the `--destination`, `--insert-after`, or `--insert-before` arguments are provided, commits will be duplicated onto their existing parents or onto other newly duplicated commits.

When any of the `--destination`, `--insert-after`, or `--insert-before` arguments are provided, the roots of the specified commits will be duplicated onto the destination indicated by the arguments. Other specified commits will be duplicated onto these newly duplicated commits. If the `--insert-after` or `--insert-before` arguments are provided, the new children indicated by the arguments will be rebased onto the heads of the specified commits.

By default, the duplicated commits retain the descriptions of the originals. This can be customized with the `templates.duplicate_description` setting.

**Usage:** `jj duplicate [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to duplicate (default: @)

###### **Options:**

* `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)



## `jj edit`

**Usage:** `jj edit <REVSET>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSET>` — The commit to edit

**Usage:** `jj evolog [OPTIONS]`

**Command Alias:** `evolution-log`

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Follow changes from these revisions

  Default value: `@`

   Applied after revisions are reordered topologically, but before being reversed.
* `--reversed` — Show revisions in the opposite order (older revisions first)
* `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of revisions
* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each revision using the given template

   Run `jj log -T` to list the built-in templates.

   You can also specify arbitrary template expressions using the [built-in keywords]. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [built-in keywords]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commit-keywords

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
* `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch compared to the previous version of this change

   If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

   The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color

**Usage:** `jj file chmod [OPTIONS] <MODE> <FILESETS>...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<MODE>`

  Possible values:
  - `n`:
    Make a path non-executable (alias: normal)

  Default value: `@`
* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render each file entry using the given template

   All 0-argument methods of the [`TreeEntry` type] are available as keywords in the template expression. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [`TreeEntry` type]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#treeentry-type

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/



## `jj file show`

Print contents of files in a revision

If the given path is a directory, files in the directory will be visited recursively.

**Usage:** `jj file show [OPTIONS] <FILESETS>...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Paths to print

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — The revision to get the file contents from

  Default value: `@`



## `jj file track`

Start tracking specified paths in the working copy

Without arguments, all paths that are not ignored will be tracked.

New files in the working copy can be automatically tracked. You can configure which paths to automatically track by setting `snapshot.auto-track` (e.g. to `"none()"` or `"glob:**/*.rs"`). Files that don't match the pattern can be manually tracked using this command. The default pattern is `all()` and this command has no effect.

**Usage:** `jj file track <FILESETS>...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Paths to track



## `jj file untrack`

Stop tracking specified paths in the working copy

**Usage:** `jj file untrack <FILESETS>...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Paths to untrack. They must already be ignored.

   The paths could be ignored via a .gitignore or .git/info/exclude (in colocated repos).



## `jj fix`

Update files with formatting fixes or other changes

The primary use case for this command is to apply the results of automatic
code formatting tools to revisions that may not be properly formatted yet.
It can also be used to modify files with other tools like `sed` or `sort`.

The changed files in the given revisions will be updated with any fixes
determined by passing their file content through any external tools the user
has configured for those files. Descendants will also be updated by passing
their versions of the same files through the same tools, which will ensure
that the fixes are not lost. This will never result in new conflicts. Files
with existing conflicts will be updated on all sides of the conflict, which
can potentially increase or decrease the number of conflict markers.

The external tools must accept the current file content on standard input,
and return the updated file content on standard output. A tool's output will
not be used unless it exits with a successful exit code. Output on standard
error will be passed through to the terminal.

Tools are defined in a table where the keys are arbitrary identifiers and
the values have the following properties:
 - `command`: The arguments used to run the tool. The first argument is the
   path to an executable file. Arguments can contain the substring `$path`,
   which will be replaced with the repo-relative path of the file being
   fixed. It is useful to provide the path to tools that include the path in
   error messages, or behave differently based on the directory or file
   name.
 - `patterns`: Determines which files the tool will affect. If this list is
   empty, no files will be affected by the tool. If there are multiple
   patterns, the tool is applied only once to each file in the union of the
   patterns.
 - `enabled`: Enables or disables the tool. If omitted, the tool is enabled.
   This is useful for defining disabled tools in user configuration that can
   be enabled in individual repositories with one config setting.

For example, the following configuration defines how two code formatters
(`clang-format` and `black`) will apply to three different file extensions
(`.cc`, `.h`, and `.py`):

```toml
[fix.tools.clang-format]
command = ["/usr/bin/clang-format", "--assume-filename=$path"]
patterns = ["glob:'**/*.cc'",
            "glob:'**/*.h'"]

[fix.tools.black]
command = ["/usr/bin/black", "-", "--stdin-filename=$path"]
patterns = ["glob:'**/*.py'"]
```

Execution order of tools that affect the same file is deterministic, but
currently unspecified, and may change between releases. If two tools affect
the same file, the second tool to run will receive its input from the
output of the first tool.

**Usage:** `jj fix [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Fix only these paths

###### **Options:**

* `-s`, `--source <REVSETS>` — Fix files in the specified revision(s) and their descendants. If no revisions are specified, this defaults to the `revsets.fix` setting, or `reachable(@, mutable())` if it is not set
* `--include-unchanged-files` — Fix unchanged files in addition to changed ones. If no paths are specified, all files in the repo will be fixed



## `jj git`

Commands for working with Git remotes and the underlying Git repo

See this [comparison], including a [table of commands].

[comparison]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/.

[table of commands]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-command-table

**Usage:** `jj git <COMMAND>`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `clone` — Create a new repo backed by a clone of a Git repo
* `export` — Update the underlying Git repo with changes made in the repo
* `fetch` — Fetch from a Git remote
* `import` — Update repo with changes made in the underlying Git repo
* `init` — Create a new Git backed repo
* `push` — Push to a Git remote
* `remote` — Manage Git remotes
* `root` — Show the underlying Git directory of a repository using the Git backend



## `jj git clone`

Create a new repo backed by a clone of a Git repo

The Git repo will be a bare git repo stored inside the `.jj/` directory.

**Usage:** `jj git clone [OPTIONS] <SOURCE> [DESTINATION]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<SOURCE>` — URL or path of the Git repo to clone

   Local path will be resolved to absolute form.
* `<DESTINATION>` — Specifies the target directory for the Jujutsu repository clone. If not provided, defaults to a directory named after the last component of the source URL. The full directory path will be created if it doesn't exist

###### **Options:**

* `--remote <REMOTE_NAME>` — Name of the newly created remote

  Default value: `origin`
* `--colocate` — Whether or not to colocate the Jujutsu repo with the git repo
* `--depth <DEPTH>` — Create a shallow clone of the given depth



## `jj git export`

Update the underlying Git repo with changes made in the repo

**Usage:** `jj git export`



## `jj git fetch`

Fetch from a Git remote

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

**Usage:** `jj git fetch [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-b`, `--branch <BRANCH>` — Fetch only some of the branches

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to expand `*` as a glob, e.g. `--branch 'glob:push-*'`. Other wildcard characters such as `?` are *not* supported.

  Default value: `glob:*`
* `--remote <REMOTE>` — The remote to fetch from (only named remotes are supported, can be repeated)

   This defaults to the `git.fetch` setting. If that is not configured, and if there are multiple remotes, the remote named "origin" will be used.

   By default, the specified remote names matches exactly. Use a [string pattern], e.g. `--remote 'glob:*'`, to select remotes using patterns.

   [string pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets#string-patterns
* `--all-remotes` — Fetch from all remotes



## `jj git import`

Update repo with changes made in the underlying Git repo

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

**Usage:** `jj git import`



## `jj git init`

Create a new Git backed repo

**Usage:** `jj git init [OPTIONS] [DESTINATION]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<DESTINATION>` — The destination directory where the `jj` repo will be created. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

   By default the `git` repo is under `$destination/.jj`

  Default value: `.`

###### **Options:**

* `--colocate` — Specifies that the `jj` repo should also be a valid `git` repo, allowing the use of both `jj` and `git` commands in the same directory.

   This is done by placing the backing git repo into a `.git` directory in the root of the `jj` repo along with the `.jj` directory. If the `.git` directory already exists, all the existing commits will be imported.

   This option is mutually exclusive with `--git-repo`.
* `--git-repo <GIT_REPO>` — Specifies a path to an **existing** git repository to be used as the backing git repo for the newly created `jj` repo.

   If the specified `--git-repo` path happens to be the same as the `jj` repo path (both .jj and .git directories are in the same working directory), then both `jj` and `git` commands will work on the same repo. This is called a co-located repo.

   This option is mutually exclusive with `--colocate`.



## `jj git push`

Push to a Git remote

By default, pushes tracking bookmarks pointing to `remote_bookmarks(remote=<remote>)..@`. Use `--bookmark` to push specific bookmarks. Use `--all` to push all bookmarks. Use `--change` to generate bookmark names based on the change IDs of specific commits.

Unlike in Git, the remote to push to is not derived from the tracked remote bookmarks. Use `--remote` to select the remote Git repository by name. There is no option to push to multiple remotes.

Before the command actually moves, creates, or deletes a remote bookmark, it makes several [safety checks]. If there is a problem, you may need to run `jj git fetch --remote <remote name>` and/or resolve some [bookmark conflicts].

[safety checks]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks/#pushing-bookmarks-safety-checks

[bookmark conflicts]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks/#conflicts

**Usage:** `jj git push [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `--remote <REMOTE>` — The remote to push to (only named remotes are supported)

   This defaults to the `git.push` setting. If that is not configured, and if there are multiple remotes, the remote named "origin" will be used.
* `-b`, `--bookmark <BOOKMARK>` — Push only this bookmark, or bookmarks matching a pattern (can be repeated)

   By default, the specified name matches exactly. Use `glob:` prefix to select bookmarks by [wildcard pattern].

   [wildcard pattern]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets#string-patterns
* `--all` — Push all bookmarks (including new bookmarks)
* `--tracked` — Push all tracked bookmarks

   This usually means that the bookmark was already pushed to or fetched from the [relevant remote].

   [relevant remote]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/bookmarks#remotes-and-tracked-bookmarks
* `--deleted` — Push all deleted bookmarks

   Only tracked bookmarks can be successfully deleted on the remote. A warning will be printed if any untracked bookmarks on the remote correspond to missing local bookmarks.
* `-N`, `--allow-new` — Allow pushing new bookmarks

   Newly-created remote bookmarks will be tracked automatically.

   This can also be turned on by the `git.push-new-bookmarks` setting. If it's set to `true`, `--allow-new` is no-op.
* `--allow-empty-description` — Allow pushing commits with empty descriptions
* `--allow-private` — Allow pushing commits that are private

   The set of private commits can be configured by the `git.private-commits` setting. The default is `none()`, meaning all commits are eligible to be pushed.
* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Push bookmarks pointing to these commits (can be repeated)
* `-c`, `--change <REVSETS>` — Push this commit by creating a bookmark based on its change ID (can be repeated)

   The created bookmark will be tracked automatically. Use the `git.push-bookmark-prefix` setting to change the prefix for generated names.
* `--named <NAME=REVISION>` — Specify a new bookmark name and a revision to push under that name, e.g. '--named myfeature=@'

   Does not require --allow-new.
* `--dry-run` — Only display what will change on the remote

* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
* `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

   A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
* `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
* `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj new`

Create a new, empty change and (by default) edit it in the working copy

By default, `jj` will edit the new change, making the [working copy] represent the new commit. This can be avoided with `--no-edit`.

Note that you can create a merge commit by specifying multiple revisions as argument. For example, `jj new @ main` will create a new commit with the working copy and the `main` bookmark as parents.

[working copy]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/

**Usage:** `jj new [OPTIONS] [REVSETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSETS>` — Parent(s) of the new change

  Default value: `@`

###### **Options:**

* `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use
* `--no-edit` — Do not edit the newly created change
* `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — Insert the new change after the given commit(s)

   Example: `jj new --after A` creates a new change between `A` and its
   children:

   ```text
                   B   C
                    \ /
       B   C   =>    @
        \ /          |
         A           A
   ```

   Specifying `--after` multiple times will relocate all children of the
   given commits.

   Example: `jj new --after A --after X` creates a change with `A` and `X`
   as parents, and rebases all children on top of the new change:

   ```text
                   B   Y
                    \ /
       B  Y    =>    @
       |  |         / \
       A  X        A   X
   ```
* `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — Insert the new change before the given commit(s)

   Example: `jj new --before C` creates a new change between `C` and its
   parents:

   ```text
                      C
                      |
         C     =>     @
        / \          / \
       A   B        A   B
   ```

   `--after` and `--before` can be combined.

   Example: `jj new --after A --before D`:

   ```text

       D            D
       |           / \
       C          |   C
       |    =>    @   |
       B          |   B
       |           \ /
       A            A
   ```

   Similar to `--after`, you can specify `--before` multiple times.



## `jj next`

Move the working-copy commit to the child revision

The command creates a new empty working copy revision that is the child of a
descendant `offset` revisions ahead of the parent of the current working
copy.

For example, when the offset is 1:

```text
D        D @
|        |/
C @  =>  C
|/       |
B        B
```

If `--edit` is passed, the working copy revision is changed to the child of
the current working copy revision.

```text
D        D
|        |
C        C
|        |
B   =>   @
|        |
@        A
```

**Usage:** `jj next [OPTIONS] [OFFSET]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OFFSET>` — How many revisions to move forward. Advances to the next child by default

  Default value: `1`

###### **Options:**

* `-e`, `--edit` — Instead of creating a new working-copy commit on top of the target commit (like `jj new`), edit the target commit directly (like `jj edit`)

   Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = false`
* `-n`, `--no-edit` — The inverse of `--edit`

   Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = true`
* `--conflict` — Jump to the next conflicted descendant



## `jj operation`

Commands for working with the operation log

See the [operation log documentation] for more information.

[operation log documentation]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/operation-log/

**Usage:** `jj operation <COMMAND>`

**Command Alias:** `op`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `abandon` — Abandon operation history
* `diff` — Compare changes to the repository between two operations

* `show` — Show changes to the repository in an operation
* `undo` — Create a new operation that undoes an earlier operation



## `jj operation abandon`

Abandon operation history

To discard old operation history, use `jj op abandon ..<operation ID>`. It will abandon the specified operation and all its ancestors. The descendants will be reparented onto the root operation.

To discard recent operations, use `jj op restore <operation ID>` followed by `jj op abandon <operation ID>..@-`.

The abandoned operations, commits, and other unreachable objects can later be garbage collected by using `jj util gc` command.

**Usage:** `jj operation abandon <OPERATION>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OPERATION>` — The operation or operation range to abandon



## `jj operation diff`

Compare changes to the repository between two operations

**Usage:** `jj operation diff [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `--operation <OPERATION>` [alias: `op`] — Show repository changes in this operation, compared to its parent
* `-f`, `--from <FROM>` — Show repository changes from this operation
* `-t`, `--to <TO>` — Show repository changes to this operation
* `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of modified changes
* `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch of modifications to changes

   If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

   The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
* `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

   A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
* `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
* `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj operation log`

Show the operation log

Like other commands, `jj op log` snapshots the current working-copy changes and reconciles divergent operations. Use `--at-op=@ --ignore-working-copy` to inspect the current state without mutation.

**Usage:** `jj operation log [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-n`, `--limit <LIMIT>` — Limit number of operations to show

   Applied after operations are reordered topologically, but before being reversed.

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
* `-d`, `--op-diff` — Show changes to the repository at each operation
* `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch of modifications to changes (implies --op-diff)

   If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

* `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj operation restore`

Create a new operation that restores the repo to an earlier state

This restores the repo to the state at the specified operation, effectively undoing all later operations. It does so by creating a new operation.

**Usage:** `jj operation restore [OPTIONS] <OPERATION>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OPERATION>` — The operation to restore to

   Use `jj op log` to find an operation to restore to. Use e.g. `jj --at-op=<operation ID> log` before restoring to an operation to see the state of the repo at that operation.

###### **Options:**

* `--what <WHAT>` — What portions of the local state to restore (can be repeated)

   This option is EXPERIMENTAL.

  Default values: `repo`, `remote-tracking`

  Possible values:
  - `repo`:
    The jj repo state and local bookmarks
  - `remote-tracking`:
    The remote-tracking bookmarks. Do not restore these if you'd like to push after the undo




## `jj operation show`

Show changes to the repository in an operation

**Usage:** `jj operation show [OPTIONS] [OPERATION]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OPERATION>` — Show repository changes in this operation, compared to its parent(s)

  Default value: `@`

###### **Options:**

* `--no-graph` — Don't show the graph, show a flat list of modified changes
* `-p`, `--patch` — Show patch of modifications to changes

   If the previous version has different parents, it will be temporarily rebased to the parents of the new version, so the diff is not contaminated by unrelated changes.
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

   The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
* `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

   A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
* `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
* `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj operation undo`

Create a new operation that undoes an earlier operation

This undoes an individual operation by applying the inverse of the operation.

**Usage:** `jj operation undo [OPTIONS] [OPERATION]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OPERATION>` — The operation to undo

   Use `jj op log` to find an operation to undo.

  Default value: `@`

###### **Options:**

* `--what <WHAT>` — What portions of the local state to restore (can be repeated)

   This option is EXPERIMENTAL.

  Default values: `repo`, `remote-tracking`

  Possible values:
  - `repo`:
    The jj repo state and local bookmarks
  - `remote-tracking`:
    The remote-tracking bookmarks. Do not restore these if you'd like to push after the undo




## `jj parallelize`

Parallelize revisions by making them siblings

Running `jj parallelize 1::2` will transform the history like this:
```text
3
|             3
2            / \
|    ->     1   2
1            \ /
|             0
0
```

The command effectively says "these revisions are actually independent",
meaning that they should no longer be ancestors/descendants of each other.
However, revisions outside the set that were previously ancestors of a
revision in the set will remain ancestors of it. For example, revision 0
above remains an ancestor of both 1 and 2. Similarly,
revisions outside the set that were previously descendants of a revision
in the set will remain descendants of it. For example, revision 3 above
remains a descendant of both 1 and 2.

Therefore, `jj parallelize '1 | 3'` is a no-op. That's because 2, which is
not in the target set, was a descendant of 1 before, so it remains a
descendant, and it was an ancestor of 3 before, so it remains an ancestor.

**Usage:** `jj parallelize [REVSETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSETS>` — Revisions to parallelize



## `jj prev`

Change the working copy revision relative to the parent revision

The command creates a new empty working copy revision that is the child of
an ancestor `offset` revisions behind the parent of the current working
copy.

For example, when the offset is 1:

```text
D @      D
|/       |
A   =>   A @
|        |/
B        B
```

If `--edit` is passed, the working copy revision is changed to the parent of
the current working copy revision.

```text
D @      D
|/       |
C   =>   @
|        |
B        B
|        |
A        A
```

**Usage:** `jj prev [OPTIONS] [OFFSET]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OFFSET>` — How many revisions to move backward. Moves to the parent by default

  Default value: `1`

###### **Options:**

* `-e`, `--edit` — Edit the parent directly, instead of moving the working-copy commit

   Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = false`
* `-n`, `--no-edit` — The inverse of `--edit`

   Takes precedence over config in `ui.movement.edit`; i.e. will negate `ui.movement.edit = true`
* `--conflict` — Jump to the previous conflicted ancestor



## `jj rebase`

Move revisions to different parent(s)

This command moves revisions to different parent(s) while preserving the
changes (diff) in the revisions.

There are three different ways of specifying which revisions to rebase:

* `--source/-s` to rebase a revision and its descendants
* `--branch/-b` to rebase a whole branch, relative to the destination
* `--revisions/-r` to rebase the specified revisions without their
  descendants

If no option is specified, it defaults to `-b @`.

There are three different ways of specifying where the revisions should be
rebased to:

* `--destination/-d` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets
* `--insert-after/-A` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets and
  to rebase the targets' descendants onto the rebased revisions
* `--insert-before/-B` to rebase the revisions onto the specified targets'
  parents and to rebase the targets and their descendants onto the rebased
  revisions

See the sections below for details about the different ways of specifying
which revisions to rebase where.

If a working-copy revision gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty
revision. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

### Specifying which revisions to rebase

With `--source/-s`, the command rebases the specified revision and its
descendants to the destination. For example, `jj rebase -s M -d O` would
transform your history like this (letters followed by an apostrophe are
post-rebase versions):

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         M'
| |         |
| M         O
| |    =>   |
| | L       | L
| |/        | |
| K         | K
|/          |/
J           J
```

Each revision passed to `-s` will become a direct child of the destination,
so if you instead run `jj rebase -s M -s N -d O` (or
`jj rebase -s 'all:M|N' -d O`) in the example above, then N' would instead
be a direct child of O.

With `--branch/-b`, the command rebases the whole "branch" containing the
specified revision. A "branch" is the set of revisions that includes:

* the specified revision and ancestors that are not also ancestors of the
  destination
* all descendants of those revisions

In other words, `jj rebase -b X -d Y` rebases revisions in the revset
`(Y..X)::` (which is equivalent to `jj rebase -s 'roots(Y..X)' -d Y` for a
single root). For example, either `jj rebase -b L -d O` or `jj rebase -b M
-d O` would transform your history like this (because `L` and `M` are on the
same "branch", relative to the destination):

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         M'
| |         |
| M         | L'
| |    =>   |/
| | L       K'
| |/        |
| K         O
|/          |
J           J
```

With `--revisions/-r`, the command rebases only the specified revisions to
the destination. Any "hole" left behind will be filled by rebasing
descendants onto the specified revisions' parent(s). For example,
`jj rebase -r K -d M` would transform your history like this:

```text
M          K'
|          |
| L        M
| |   =>   |
| K        | L'
|/         |/
J          J
```

Multiple revisions can be specified, and any dependencies (graph edges)
within the set will be preserved. For example, `jj rebase -r 'K|N' -d O`
would transform your history like this:

```text
O           N'
|           |
| N         K'
| |         |
| M         O
| |    =>   |
| | L       | M'
| |/        |/
| K         | L'
|/          |/
J           J
```

`jj rebase -s X` is similar to `jj rebase -r X::` and will behave the same
if X is a single revision. However, if X is a set of multiple revisions,
or if you passed multiple `-s` arguments, then `jj rebase -s` will make each
of the specified revisions an immediate child of the destination, while
`jj rebase -r` will preserve dependencies within the set.

Note that you can create a merge revision by repeating the `-d` argument.
For example, if you realize that revision L actually depends on revision M
in order to work (in addition to its current parent K), you can run `jj
rebase -s L -d K -d M`:

```text
M          L'
|          |\
| L        M |
| |   =>   | |
| K        | K
|/         |/
J          J
```

### Specifying where to rebase the revisions

With `--destination/-d`, the command rebases the selected revisions onto
the targets. Existing descendants of the targets will not be affected. See
the section above for examples.

With `--insert-after/-A`, the selected revisions will be inserted after the
targets. This is similar to `-d`, but if the targets have any existing
descendants, then those will be rebased onto the rebased selected revisions.

For example, `jj rebase -r K -A L` will rewrite history like this:
```text
N           N'
|           |
| M         | M'
|/          |/
L      =>   K'
|           |
| K         L
|/          |
J           J
```

The `-A` (and `-B`) argument can also be used for reordering revisions. For
example, `jj rebase -r M -A J` will rewrite history like this:
```text
M          L'
|          |
L          K'
|     =>   |
K          M'
|          |
J          J
```

With `--insert-before/-B`, the selected revisions will be inserted before
the targets. This is achieved by rebasing the selected revisions onto the
target revisions' parents, and then rebasing the target revisions and their
descendants onto the rebased revisions.

For example, `jj rebase -r K -B L` will rewrite history like this:
```text
N           N'
|           |
| M         | M'
|/          |/
L     =>    L'
|           |
| K         K'
|/          |
J           J
```

The `-A` and `-B` arguments can also be combined, which can be useful around
merges. For example, you can use `jj rebase -r K -A J -B M` to create a new
merge (but `jj rebase -r M -d L -d K` might be simpler in this particular
case):
```text
M           M'
|           |\
L           L |
|     =>    | |
| K         | K'
|/          |/
J           J
```

To insert a commit inside an existing merge with `jj rebase -r O -A K -B M`:
```text
O           N'
|           |\
N           | M'
|\          | |\
| M         | O'|
| |    =>   |/ /
| L         | L
| |         | |
K |         K |
|/          |/
J           J
```

**Usage:** `jj rebase [OPTIONS] <--destination <REVSETS>|--insert-after <REVSETS>|--insert-before <REVSETS>>`

###### **Options:**

* `-b`, `--branch <REVSETS>` — Rebase the whole branch relative to destination's ancestors (can be repeated)

   `jj rebase -b=br -d=dst` is equivalent to `jj rebase '-s=roots(dst..br)' -d=dst`.

   If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
* `-s`, `--source <REVSETS>` — Rebase specified revision(s) together with their trees of descendants (can be repeated)

   Each specified revision will become a direct child of the destination revision(s), even if some of the source revisions are descendants of others.

   If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Rebase the given revisions, rebasing descendants onto this revision's parent(s)

   Unlike `-s` or `-b`, you may `jj rebase -r` a revision `A` onto a descendant of `A`.

   If none of `-b`, `-s`, or `-r` is provided, then the default is `-b @`.
* `-d`, `--destination <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to rebase onto (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `--skip-emptied` — If true, when rebasing would produce an empty commit, the commit is abandoned. It will not be abandoned if it was already empty before the rebase. Will never skip merge commits with multiple non-empty parents
* `--keep-divergent` — Keep divergent commits while rebasing

   Without this flag, divergent commits are abandoned while rebasing if another commit with the same change ID is already present in the destination with identical changes.
* `--restore-snapshots <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to preserve the content of (not the diff)



## `jj resolve`

Resolve conflicted files with an external merge tool

Only conflicts that can be resolved with a 3-way merge are supported. See docs for merge tool configuration instructions. External merge tools will be invoked for each conflicted file one-by-one until all conflicts are resolved. To stop resolving conflicts, exit the merge tool without making any changes.

Note that conflicts can also be resolved without using this command. You may edit the conflict markers in the conflicted file directly with a text editor.

**Usage:** `jj resolve [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Only resolve conflicts in these paths. You can use the `--list` argument to find paths to use here

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>`

  Default value: `@`
* `-l`, `--list` — Instead of resolving conflicts, list all the conflicts
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify 3-way merge tool to be used

   The built-in merge tools `:ours` and `:theirs` can be used to choose side #1 and side #2 of the conflict respectively.



## `jj restore`

Restore paths from another revision

That means that the paths get the same content in the destination (`--to`) as they had in the source (`--from`). This is typically used for undoing changes to some paths in the working copy (`jj restore <paths>`).

If only one of `--from` or `--to` is specified, the other one defaults to the working copy.

When neither `--from` nor `--to` is specified, the command restores into the working copy from its parent(s). `jj restore` without arguments is similar to `jj abandon`, except that it leaves an empty revision with its description and other metadata preserved.

See `jj diffedit` if you'd like to restore portions of files rather than entire files.

**Usage:** `jj restore [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Restore only these paths (instead of all paths)

###### **Options:**

* `-f`, `--from <REVSET>` — Revision to restore from (source)
* `-t`, `--into <REVSET>` [alias: `to`] — Revision to restore into (destination)
* `-c`, `--changes-in <REVSET>` — Undo the changes in a revision as compared to the merge of its parents.

   This undoes the changes that can be seen with `jj diff -r REVSET`. If `REVSET` only has a single parent, this option is equivalent to `jj restore --into REVSET --from REVSET-`.

   The default behavior of `jj restore` is equivalent to `jj restore --changes-in @`.
* `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which parts to restore
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
* `--restore-descendants` — Preserve the content (not the diff) when rebasing descendants



## `jj revert`

Apply the reverse of the given revision(s)

The reverse of each of the given revisions is applied sequentially in reverse topological order at the given location.

The description of the new revisions can be customized with the `templates.revert_description` config variable.

**Usage:** `jj revert [OPTIONS] <--destination <REVSETS>|--insert-after <REVSETS>|--insert-before <REVSETS>>`

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to apply the reverse of
* `-d`, `--destination <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to apply the reverse changes on top of
* `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert the reverse changes after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert the reverse changes before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)



## `jj root`

Show the current workspace root directory (shortcut for `jj workspace root`)

**Usage:** `jj root`



## `jj show`

Show commit description and changes in a revision

**Usage:** `jj show [OPTIONS] [REVSET]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<REVSET>` — Show changes in this revision, compared to its parent(s)

  Default value: `@`

###### **Options:**

* `-T`, `--template <TEMPLATE>` — Render a revision using the given template

   You can specify arbitrary template expressions using the [built-in keywords]. See [`jj help -k templates`] for more information.

   [built-in keywords]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/#commit-keywords

   [`jj help -k templates`]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/templates/
* `-s`, `--summary` — For each path, show only whether it was modified, added, or deleted
* `--stat` — Show a histogram of the changes
* `--types` — For each path, show only its type before and after

   The diff is shown as two letters. The first letter indicates the type before and the second letter indicates the type after. '-' indicates that the path was not present, 'F' represents a regular file, `L' represents a symlink, 'C' represents a conflict, and 'G' represents a Git submodule.
* `--name-only` — For each path, show only its path

   Typically useful for shell commands like: `jj diff -r @- --name-only | xargs perl -pi -e's/OLD/NEW/g`
* `--git` — Show a Git-format diff
* `--color-words` — Show a word-level diff with changes indicated only by color
* `--tool <TOOL>` — Generate diff by external command

   A builtin format can also be specified as `:<name>`. For example, `--tool=:git` is equivalent to `--git`.
* `--context <CONTEXT>` — Number of lines of context to show
* `--no-patch` — Do not show the patch
* `-w`, `--ignore-all-space` — Ignore whitespace when comparing lines
* `-b`, `--ignore-space-change` — Ignore changes in amount of whitespace when comparing lines



## `jj sign`

Cryptographically sign a revision

This command requires configuring a [commit signing] backend.

[commit signing]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#commit-signing

**Usage:** `jj sign [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — What revision(s) to sign

   If no revisions are specified, this defaults to the `revsets.sign` setting.

   Note that revisions are always re-signed.

   While that leads to discomfort for users, which sign with hardware devices, as of now we cannot reliably check if a commit is already signed by the user without creating a signature (see [#5786]).

   [#5786]: https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/5786
* `--key <KEY>` — The key used for signing



## `jj simplify-parents`

Simplify parent edges for the specified revision(s).

Removes all parents of each of the specified revisions that are also indirect ancestors of the same revisions through other parents. This has no effect on any revision's contents, including the working copy.

In other words, for all (A, B, C) where A has (B, C) as parents and C is an ancestor of B, A will be rewritten to have only B as a parent instead of B+C.

**Usage:** `jj simplify-parents [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-s`, `--source <REVSETS>` — Simplify specified revision(s) together with their trees of descendants (can be repeated)
* `-r`, `--revisions <REVSETS>` — Simplify specified revision(s) (can be repeated)

   If both `--source` and `--revisions` are not provided, this defaults to the `revsets.simplify-parents` setting, or `reachable(@, mutable())` if it is not set.



## `jj sparse`

Manage which paths from the working-copy commit are present in the working copy

**Usage:** `jj sparse <COMMAND>`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `edit` — Start an editor to update the patterns that are present in the working copy
* `list` — List the patterns that are currently present in the working copy
* `reset` — Reset the patterns to include all files in the working copy
* `set` — Update the patterns that are present in the working copy



## `jj sparse edit`

Start an editor to update the patterns that are present in the working copy

**Usage:** `jj sparse edit`



## `jj sparse list`

List the patterns that are currently present in the working copy

By default, a newly cloned or initialized repo will have have a pattern matching all files from the repo root. That pattern is rendered as `.` (a single period).

**Usage:** `jj sparse list`



## `jj sparse reset`

Reset the patterns to include all files in the working copy

**Usage:** `jj sparse reset`



## `jj sparse set`

Update the patterns that are present in the working copy

For example, if all you need is the `README.md` and the `lib/` directory, use `jj sparse set --clear --add README.md --add lib`. If you no longer need the `lib` directory, use `jj sparse set --remove lib`.

**Usage:** `jj sparse set [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `--add <ADD>` — Patterns to add to the working copy
* `--remove <REMOVE>` — Patterns to remove from the working copy
* `--clear` — Include no files in the working copy (combine with --add)



## `jj split`

Split a revision in two

Starts a [diff editor] on the changes in the revision. Edit the right side of the diff until it has the content you want in the new revision. Once you close the editor, your edited content will replace the previous revision. The remaining changes will be put in a new revision on top.

[diff editor]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/config/#editing-diffs

If the change you split had a description, you will be asked to enter a change description for each commit. If the change did not have a description, the remaining changes will not get a description, and you will be asked for a description only for the selected changes.

Splitting an empty commit is not supported because the same effect can be achieved with `jj new`.

**Usage:** `jj split [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Files matching any of these filesets are put in the selected changes

###### **Options:**

* `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which parts to split

   This is the default if no filesets are provided.
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — The revision to split

  Default value: `@`
* `-d`, `--destination <REVSETS>` — The revision(s) to rebase onto (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-A`, `--insert-after <REVSETS>` [alias: `after`] — The revision(s) to insert after (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-B`, `--insert-before <REVSETS>` [alias: `before`] — The revision(s) to insert before (can be repeated to create a merge commit)
* `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The change description to use (don't open editor)

   The description is used for the commit with the selected changes. The source commit description is kept unchanged.
* `-p`, `--parallel` — Split the revision into two parallel revisions instead of a parent and child



## `jj squash`

Move changes from a revision into another revision

With the `-r` option, moves the changes from the specified revision to the parent revision. Fails if there are several parent revisions (i.e., the given revision is a merge).

With the `--from` and/or `--into` options, moves changes from/to the given revisions. If either is left out, it defaults to the working-copy commit. For example, `jj squash --into @--` moves changes from the working-copy commit to the grandparent.

If, after moving changes out, the source revision is empty compared to its parent(s), and `--keep-emptied` is not set, it will be abandoned. Without `--interactive` or paths, the source revision will always be empty.

If the source was abandoned and both the source and destination had a non-empty description, you will be asked for the combined description. If either was empty, then the other one will be used.

If a working-copy commit gets abandoned, it will be given a new, empty commit. This is true in general; it is not specific to this command.

**Usage:** `jj squash [OPTIONS] [FILESETS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<FILESETS>` — Move only changes to these paths (instead of all paths)

###### **Options:**

* `-r`, `--revision <REVSET>` — Revision to squash into its parent (default: @)
* `-f`, `--from <REVSETS>` — Revision(s) to squash from (default: @)
* `-t`, `--into <REVSET>` [alias: `to`] — Revision to squash into (default: @)
* `-m`, `--message <MESSAGE>` — The description to use for squashed revision (don't open editor)
* `-u`, `--use-destination-message` — Use the description of the destination revision and discard the description(s) of the source revision(s)
* `-i`, `--interactive` — Interactively choose which parts to squash
* `--tool <NAME>` — Specify diff editor to be used (implies --interactive)
* `-k`, `--keep-emptied` — The source revision will not be abandoned



## `jj status`

## `jj util config-schema`

Print the JSON schema for the jj TOML config format

**Usage:** `jj util config-schema`



## `jj util exec`

Execute an external command via jj

This is useful for arbitrary aliases.

!! WARNING !!

The following technique just provides a convenient syntax for running
arbitrary code on your system. Using it irresponsibly may cause damage
ranging from breaking the behavior of `jj undo` to wiping your file system.
Exercise the same amount of caution while writing these aliases as you would
when typing commands into the terminal!

This feature may be removed or replaced by an embedded scripting language in
the future.

Let's assume you have a script called "my-jj-script" in you $PATH and you
would like to execute it as "jj my-script". You would add the following line
to your configuration file to achieve that:

```toml
[aliases]
my-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "my-jj-script"]
#                            ^^^^
# This makes sure that flags are passed to your script instead of parsed by jj.
```

If you don't want to manage your script as a separate file, you can even
inline it into your config file:

```toml
[aliases]
my-inline-script = ["util", "exec", "--", "bash", "-c", """
set -euo pipefail
echo "Look Ma, everything in one file!"
echo "args: $@"
""", ""]
#    ^^
# This last empty string will become "$0" in bash, so your actual arguments
# are all included in "$@" and start at "$1" as expected.
```

> Note: Shebangs (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env`) aren't necessary since you're
> already explicitly passing your script into the right shell.

**Usage:** `jj util exec <COMMAND> [ARGS]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<COMMAND>` — External command to execute
* `<ARGS>` — Arguments to pass to the external command



## `jj util gc`

Run backend-dependent garbage collection.

To garbage-collect old operations and the commits/objects referenced by them, run `jj op abandon ..<some old operation>` before `jj util gc`.

Previous versions of a change that are reachable via the evolution log are not garbage-collected.

**Usage:** `jj util gc [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `--expire <EXPIRE>` — Time threshold

   By default, only obsolete objects and operations older than 2 weeks are pruned.

   Only the string "now" can be passed to this parameter. Support for arbitrary absolute and relative timestamps will come in a subsequent release.



## `jj util install-man-pages`

Install Jujutsu's manpages to the provided path

**Usage:** `jj util install-man-pages <PATH>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<PATH>` — The path where manpages will installed. An example path might be `/usr/share/man`. The provided path will be appended with `man1`, etc., as appropriate



## `jj util markdown-help`

Print the CLI help for all subcommands in Markdown

**Usage:** `jj util markdown-help`



## `jj version`

Display version information

**Usage:** `jj version`



## `jj workspace`

Commands for working with workspaces

Workspaces let you add additional working copies attached to the same repo. A common use case is so you can run a slow build or test in one workspace while you're continuing to write code in another workspace.

Each workspace has its own working-copy commit. When you have more than one workspace attached to a repo, they are indicated by `<workspace name>@` in `jj log`.

Each workspace also has own sparse patterns.

**Usage:** `jj workspace <COMMAND>`

###### **Subcommands:**

* `add` — Add a workspace
* `forget` — Stop tracking a workspace's working-copy commit in the repo
* `list` — List workspaces
* `rename` — Renames the current workspace
* `root` — Show the current workspace root directory
* `update-stale` — Update a workspace that has become stale



## `jj workspace add`

Add a workspace

By default, the new workspace inherits the sparse patterns of the current workspace. You can override this with the `--sparse-patterns` option.

**Usage:** `jj workspace add [OPTIONS] <DESTINATION>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<DESTINATION>` — Where to create the new workspace

###### **Options:**

* `--name <NAME>` — A name for the workspace

   To override the default, which is the basename of the destination directory.
* `-r`, `--revision <REVSETS>` — A list of parent revisions for the working-copy commit of the newly created workspace. You may specify nothing, or any number of parents.

   If no revisions are specified, the new workspace will be created, and its working-copy commit will exist on top of the parent(s) of the working-copy commit in the current workspace, i.e. they will share the same parent(s).

   If any revisions are specified, the new workspace will be created, and the new working-copy commit will be created with all these revisions as parents, i.e. the working-copy commit will exist as if you had run `jj new r1 r2 r3 ...`.
* `--sparse-patterns <SPARSE_PATTERNS>` — How to handle sparse patterns when creating a new workspace

  Default value: `copy`

  Possible values:
  - `copy`:
    Copy all sparse patterns from the current workspace
  - `full`:
    Include all files in the new workspace
  - `empty`:
    Clear all files from the workspace (it will be empty)




## `jj workspace forget`

Stop tracking a workspace's working-copy commit in the repo

The workspace will not be touched on disk. It can be deleted from disk before or after running this command.

**Usage:** `jj workspace forget [WORKSPACES]...`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<WORKSPACES>` — Names of the workspaces to forget. By default, forgets only the current workspace



## `jj workspace list`

List workspaces

**Usage:** `jj workspace list`



## `jj workspace rename`

Renames the current workspace

**Usage:** `jj workspace rename <NEW_WORKSPACE_NAME>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NEW_WORKSPACE_NAME>` — The name of the workspace to update to



## `jj workspace root`

Show the current workspace root directory

**Usage:** `jj workspace root`



## `jj workspace update-stale`

Update a workspace that has become stale

See the [stale working copy documentation] for more information.

[stale working copy documentation]: https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/#stale-working-copy

**Usage:** `jj workspace update-stale`
